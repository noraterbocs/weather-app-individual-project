# weather-app-individual-project

This project was initially a pair project, but I have decided to take it further and customize it more on my own.
The main goal of this project was to learn how to work on separate branches, how to fetch api and use the retrieved data from the json.

## The problem

In this project HTML,CSS and Javascript were used.

Further improvements:
Geo location button's hover effect should be fixed and a pop up window could be added to turn it on and off. For now it gets overwritten if a city is selected from the dropdown, and if the user clicks on the location icon the geolocation gets activated again.
